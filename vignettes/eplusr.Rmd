eplusr provides a rich toolkit of using whole building energy simulation program
[EnergyPlus](https://energyplus.net) directly in R, which enables programmatic
navigation, modification of EnergyPlus models and makes it less painful to do
parametric simulations and analysis. More information about EnergyPlus can be
found at [its website](https://energyplus.net).

## Installation

You can install the latest stable release of eplusr from CRAN.

```{r cran-install, eval = FALSE}
install.packages("eplusr")
```

Alternatively, you can install the development version from GitHub.

```{r gh-installation, eval = FALSE}
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("hongyuanjia/eplusr")
```

Since running the IDF files requires EnergyPlus (https://energyplus.net),
EnergyPlus has to be installed if you want to run EnergyPlus models in R.  There
are helper functions in eplusr to download and install it automatically on major
operating systems (Windows, macOS and Linux):

```{r eplus-install, eval = FALSE}
# install the latest version (currently v8.9.0)
eplusr::install_eplus("latest")

# OR download the latest version (currently v8.9.0) and run the installer
# manually by yourself
eplusr::download_eplus("latest", dir = tempdir())
```

Note that the installation process in `install_eplus()` requires
**administrative privileges**. You have to run R with administrator (or with
sudo if you are on macOS or Linux) to make it work if you are not in interactive
mode.

```{r install_eplus, include = FALSE, eval = can_run}
if (!eplusr::is_avail_eplus(8.8)) {
    if (eplusr:::is_windows()) {
        eplusr::install_eplus(8.8)
    } else {
        base <- "https://github.com/NREL/EnergyPlus/releases/download/v8.8.0"
        plat <- switch(eplusr:::os_type(), linux = "Linux", macos = "Darwin")
        file <- paste0("EnergyPlus-8.8.0-7c3bbe4830-", plat, "-x86_64.tar.gz")
        url <- file.path(base, file)
        dest <- file.path(tempdir(), file)
        dl <- eplusr:::download_file(url, dest)
        eplus_dir <- paste0("EnergyPlus-8.8.0-7c3bbe4830-", plat, "-x86_64/EnergyPlus-8-8-0")
        untar(dest, exdir = tempdir())
        eplusr::use_eplus(file.path(tempdir(), eplus_dir))
    }
}
```

## Class structure

Below shows the class structure in eplusr.

```{r, results = "asis", echo = FALSE, eval = can_run}
cat('
<p align="center">
  <img src="../man/figures/class_structure.png"/>
</p>
')
```

Basically, eplusr uses `Idf` class to present the whole IDF file and `IdfObject`
class to present a single object in an IDF. Both `Idf` and `IdfObject` class
contain member functions for helping modify the data in IDF so it complies with
the underlying EnergyPlus IDD (Input Data Dictionary). Similarly, IDD file is
wrapped into two classes, i.e. `Idd` and `IddObject`.

Besides, `Epw` class is used to present EnergyPlus Weather files; `EplusJob` to
run single EnergyPlus simulation and collect outputs, `ParametricJob` to run
parametric EnergyPlus simulations and collect all outputs.

It is highly recommended to read the documentation to get a thorough
understanding on each class.

```{r copy_example, include = FALSE, eval = can_run}
library(eplusr)

cfg <- eplus_config(8.8)

example_name <- "5Zone_Transformer.idf"
weather_name <- "USA_CA_San.Francisco.Intl.AP.724940_TMY3.epw"
ddy_name <- "USA_CA_San.Francisco.Intl.AP.724940_TMY3.ddy"

path_example <- file.path(cfg$dir, "ExampleFiles", example_name)
path_weather <- file.path(cfg$dir, "WeatherData", weather_name)
path_ddy <- file.path(cfg$dir, "WeatherData", ddy_name)

file.copy(path_example, tempdir(), overwrite = TRUE)
file.copy(c(path_weather, path_ddy),
  file.path(tempdir(), c("San_Francisco.epw", "San_Francisco.ddy")), overwrite = TRUE)
```

## Read and parse

All IDF reading process starts with function `read_idf()`, which returns an `Idf`
object. The model will be printed in a similar style you see in IDFEditor, with
additional heading lines showing the `Path`, `Version` of the model. The classes
of objects in the model are ordered by groups and the number of objects in
classes are shown in square bracket.

Parsing an IDF requires the IDD data of that version, which serves as the
schema. Usually, when you try to edit an IDF, the corresponding EnergyPlus is
likely to be installed already. If EnergyPlus is installed in standard location
(`C:\EnergyPlusVX-Y-0` on Windows, `/usr/local/EnergyPlus-X-Y-0` on Linux and
`/Applications/EnergyPlus-X-Y-0` on macOS), eplusr is able to find it and use
the `Energy+.idd` file distributed with that release to parse the input IDF.
The IDD file will be parsed first and an `Idd` object will be created and
cached. That `Idd` object will be reused whenever parsing IDFs with that
version. For more details, please see `?use_idd()` and `?idd`.

Sometimes you may just want to edit the model without installing the whole
EnergyPlus software. You can just download the IDD file of that version using
`download_idd()` or set `download` to `TRUE` in `use_idd()`.

```{r idd_dl, eval = FALSE}
path_idd <- download_idd(8.8)
use_idd(path_idd)

# OR
use_idd(8.8, download = TRUE)
```

Now let's read an IDF file distributed with EnergyPlus 8.8.0. As EnergyPlus
v8.8.0 has been installed, we can just ignore the `idd` argument.

```{r idd_solaris, include = FALSE, eval = !can_run}
use_idd(8.8, download = TRUE)
path_example <- "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/NREL/EnergyPlus/v8.8.0/testfiles/5Zone_Transformer.idf"
path_weather <- "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/NREL/EnergyPlus/v8.8.0/weather/USA_CA_San.Francisco.Intl.AP.724940_TMY3.epw"
path_ddy <- "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/NREL/EnergyPlus/v8.8.0/weather/USA_CA_San.Francisco.Intl.AP.724940_TMY3.ddy"

eplusr:::download_file(path_example, file.path(tempdir(), basename(path_example)))
eplusr:::download_file(path_weather, file.path(tempdir(), "San_Francisco.epw"))
eplusr:::download_file(path_ddy, file.path(tempdir(), "San_Francisco.ddy"))
```

```{r read, out.lines = 30}
model <- read_idf(path = "5Zone_Transformer.idf", idd = NULL)

model
```

`Idf` class contains several methods to help query, modify models. Here lists
all methods it has.

```{r idf_methods}
setdiff(ls(model), "initialize")
```

Below will show same example usage of methods listed above.

## Basic Info

If you want to see all groups and classes in your model, use `$group_name()` and
`$class_name()` respectively.

```{r all_grp, out.lines = 14}
model$group_name()
```

```{r all_cls, out.lines = 14}
model$class_name()
```

Also `$is_valid_group()` and `$is_valid_class()` are provided to check if given
group and class exists in current model.

## Class definition

You can get class definitions using `$definition()`, which returns a list
of `IddObject`s. All required fields in each class are marked with
`r cli::symbol$bullet`. For example, you can get the `IddObject` of class
`Material`:

```{r all_field}
def_mat <- model$definition(class = "Material")[[1]]
def_mat
```

You can also achieve this using methods in `Idd` class.

```{r idd_obj}
idd <- use_idd(8.8)

idd$Material

# OR
# idd$object("Material")[[1]]
```

With the `IddObject`, you can easily get class and field properties using
methods it has.

```{r iddobj_methods}
setdiff(ls(def_mat), "initialize")
```

For example, you can get all default field values using `$field_default()`.

```{r mat_def}
def_val <- def_mat$field_default()
def_val
```

As we did not give any field index or name, a list will be returned containing
default values of all fields. The type of each value will be consistent with the
field definition.

```{r def_type}
vapply(def_val, class, character(1))
```

> NOTE: For numeric fields with default values being `"autosize"` or
> `"autocalculate"`, the type of returned values will be "character".

Please see `?idd_object` for detailed documentation on `IddObject`.

## Get object

In an `Idf`, all objects in the model are assigned with an unique `ID` according
to their appearance sequences in the IDF. You can find all valid `ID`s using
`$object_id()`.

```{r all_id, out.lines = 20}
model$object_id(class = c("Material", "Construction"), simplify = FALSE)
```

You can get all object names using `$object_name()`. If the class does not have
name attribute, `NA` will returned.

```{r obj_nm}
model$object_name(class = c("Version", "Material", "Construction"), simplify = FALSE)
```

Object number in each class can be retrieved using `$object_num()`.

```{r obj_num}
model$object_num(c("BuildingSurface:Detailed", "Material", "Output:Variable"))
```

Having the object ID or name, you can easily get any object using `$object()`.

> NOTE: The matching of object names is case-insensitive. For instance,
> `model$object("rOoF")` is equivalent to `model$object("roof")`.

`$object()` returns a list of `IdfObject`s. The names of returned list are
object names, except that all names are converted into valid R names, i.e. all
other characters except letters and numbers are replaced by underscore. (Below
this pattern will be referred as "underscore-style")

```{r obj}
model$object(c("WD10", "ROOF-1"))
```

If you want to get all objects in a single class, use `$object_in_class()`.

```{r obj_in_cls, out.lines = 30}
model$object_in_class("Material")
```

Also, you can get all objects in a single class using `"$"` or `"[["`.  Class
names can be given in underscore-style, which is handy. For example, you can
just use `model$Material_NoMass` instead of `` model$`Material:Nomass` `` to
save some typing.

```{r obj_in_cls_shortcut_1, out.lines = 30}
model$Material_NoMass
# OR
# model[["Material_NoMass"]]
```

Based on the above, if you want to get the first object in class `RunPeriod`,
you can simply run:

```{r rp}
rp <- model$RunPeriod[[1]]
rp
```

`$search_object()` will search and return a list of objects whose names meet the
regular expression you give.

```{r search_obj, out.lines = 20}
model$search_object("Demand", class = "Branch")
```

> NOTE: Under the hook, `stringr::str_detect` is used for matching, which is
> case-sensitive by default. If you want more controls on how the matching is
> performed, build your regular expression using `stringr::regex`.

After you get the objects, you can perform detailed modifications on them using
methods in `IdfObject`. Below lists all methods it has.

```{r idfobj_methods}
setdiff(ls(rp), "initialize")
```

Similarly, you can use `"$"` and `"[["` to get a single value in
an `IdfObject` class or `"["` to get multiple values just like normal lists in
R.

```{r s3_obj}
rp$Begin_Day_of_Month

# OR
rp[["Begin_Day_of_Month"]]
rp[[3]]
```

You can also make a chain.

```{r chain}
model$RunPeriod$WinterDay$Begin_Day_of_Month
```

## Modify object

There are two ways to modify objects in eplusr. One is using methods in `Idf`
which works on multiple objects, and the other way is using methods in
`IdfObject` which only works for a single object.

> NOTE: Validations are performed during object modifications under different
> strictness level (`none`, `draft`, `final`). For detailed explanations,
> please see `?eplusr_option()`.

You can duplicate, add, insert, modify and delete objects using `$dup_object()`,
`$add_object()`, `$ins_object()`, `$set_object()` and `$del_object()` in `Idf`,
respectively.

Object IDs will be appended after `$dup_object()`, `$add_object()` and
`$ins_object()`, and the newly added object will have the max
ID. Object IDs will never be reused, even though their binded objects have
been deleted using `$del_object()`.

For modifying object's comments and values, you can also use `$set_comment()`
and `$set_value()` in `IdfObject` class.

### Duplicate objects

`$dup_object()` will duplicate objects specified by object IDs or names. If the
target classes have a name attribute, you can assign new names to the duplicated
objects using argument `new_name`. If `new_name` is `NULL`, which is default,
the newly added object will have the same name as the original object except a
appended suffix of "`_1`", "`_2`" and etc.

```{r dup}
model$dup_object(c("ROOF-1", "ROOF-1", "WALL-1"))
```

### Add new objects

You can add new objects using `$add_object()`. With `default` being `TRUE`, all
empty fields are filled with default values, if possible. Only minimum fields
will be added by default. But you can change it by setting `all` to `TRUE`.

Field values should be given in a list following either pattern below:

* directly list all field values with no name. The values will be assigned to
  fields according to the appearance order;
* give both field names *without units* and values in pair, e.g. `` Name =
  "Test", `Begin Month` = 1 ``. You can find all valid field names using
  `$definition("class_name")[[1]]$field_name()`. Field names can also be given
  in underscore-style, e.g. `Name = "Test", begin_month = 1` (NOTE: matching is
  case-insensitive).

You can also add new comments alongside with new values.

For example, here we add two new objects in `RunPeriod`:

```{r add_obj}
model$add_object(rep("RunPeriod", 2),
  value = list(
    list("rp_test_1", 1, 1, 2, 1),

    list(name = "rp_test_2",
         begin_month = 3,
         begin_day_of_month = 1,
         end_month = 4,
         end_day_of_month = 1)
    ),
  comment = list(
    list("Comment for new object 1", "Another comment"),
    list("Comment for new object 2")),
  default = TRUE
)
```

### Set new values and comments

Changing values of existing objects can be conducted using `$set_object()` in
`Idf` or `$set_value()` in `IdfObject`. Basic rules above of field values
provided also apply to `$set_object()`, i.e. you should give either named values
or non-named values in lists. For example:

```{r set_obj}
model$set_object("rp_test_1", list(name = "rp_test_3", begin_day_of_month = 2),
  comment = list(format(Sys.Date()), "begin day has been changed."))
```

Also, if the modified fields are referenced by fields in other objects, the
corresponding fields will also be updated. You can check that by comparing the
values referencing the target object before and after.

```{r set_ref}
mat <- model$Material$CC03

# get other objects referencing this object
mat$ref_by_object()

mat$set_value(name = "CC03_renamed")

mat$ref_by_object()
```

Sometimes, you may want to get all possible values of fields before you change
them. You can achieve that by using `$possible_value()` method in `IdfObject`
class.

```{r possible}
mat$possible_value()
```

### Insert objects

Sometimes it may be useful to insert objects from other IDFs. For example, you
may want to import some design days from a ".ddy" file. You can achieve that
using `$ins_object()`.

```{r ddy, warning=TRUE, out.lines = 20}
# read ddy file as normal IDF
ddy <- read_idf("San_Francisco.ddy", idd = 8.8)

model$ins_object(ddy$SizingPeriod_DesignDay)
```

### Delete object

`$del_object()` will delete current objects specified by object IDs or names.
For example, in current model, there is a material named `"MAT-CLNG-1"` in class
`Material:NoMass`. You can get objects referencing `MAT-CLNG-1` by using
`$ref_by_object()` in `IdfObject`.

```{r ref_by}
clng <- model$Material_NoMass$MAT_CLNG_1
clng$ref_by_object()
```
As we can see, `MAT-CLNG-1` has been referenced by a construction named
`"CLNG-1"`. In `final` validate level, if the object is referenced by other
object(s), it cannot be deleted.

```{r del, error = TRUE}
eplusr_option("validate_level")
model$del_object("mat-clng-1")
```

In some cases, you may still want to delete that object. You can do that by
changing validate level to `draft` or `none`. For detail explanations on
each validate level, please see `?eplusr_option()`.

You can also delete objects referencing the target objects as well, by setting
`referenced` to `TRUE`.

```{r del_force}
eplusr_option(validate_level = "draft")
invisible(model$del_object("mat-clng-1", referenced = TRUE))
```

## Validate

`$validate()` will check the validation of all fields in current model, including
missing required objects and fields, wrong value types, choices, references,
any value range exceeding, invalid autosizable and autocalculatable fields.
`$is_valid()` will return `TRUE` if no error is found.  Validate level can be
changed using `eplusr_option()`. The default level is `final`, which is the
strictest level.

Material `MAT-CLNG-1` and construction `CLNG-1` have been all deleted in above.
After that, invalid references will be detected during model validation, as
construction `CLNG-1` was referenced by many other objects in
`BuildingSurface:Detailed`. And also, invalid autocalculate fields in this model
are detected.

```{r valid, error = TRUE}
eplusr_option(validate_level = "final")
model$validate()
```

## Save

You can save your model using `$save()`. If no path is given, the path of model
itself will be used. This may overwrite the current file which has a risk of
losing your original file and data. You have to set `overwrite` to `TRUE` to
confirm the process.

```{r save, eval = FALSE}
model$save(overwrite = TRUE)

model$save("test.idf")
```

## Run and Collect Output

eplusr uses the EnergyPlus command line interface which was introduced since
EnergyPlus v8.3.0, which means that `$run()` only supports models with version
higher than v8.3.0.

eplusr will auto-detect already installed EnergyPlus in the standard
installation locations. You can get all detected EnergyPlus versions using
`avail_eplus()`.

```{r avail_eplus}
avail_eplus()
```

`$run()` will issue an error if corresponding version of EnergyPlus is not found.
If your EnergyPlus was not installed in standard location, you can add that
location into eplusr EnergyPlus location dictionary using `use_eplus()`.

```{r use_eplus, eval = FALSE}
use_eplus("C:/EnergyPlusV8-8-0")
```

If the needed version of EnergyPlus was not installed, you can use
`install_eplus()` to install it.

```{r install, eval = FALSE}
install_eplus(ver = 8.9)
```

Sometimes, before simulation, it may be useful to retrieve weather data from
EnergyPlus Weather (EPW) file and conduct analysis on the weather. eplusr
provides `read_epw()` to let you read an EPW file and `Epw` class to query and
modify weather data.

```{r epw}
epw_sf <- read_epw("San_Francisco.epw")
epw_sf
```

`read_epw()` returns an `Epw` object. For details on `Epw` class, please see
`?epw`. Below are all methods of `Epw`:

```{r epw_method}
setdiff(ls(epw_sf), "initialize")
```

You can get all weather data using `$get_data()`.

```{r epw_data}
epw_data <- epw_sf$get_data()
str(epw_data)
```

`$run()` will run the current model with specified weather using corresponding
version of EnergyPlus. The model and the weather used will be copied to the
output directory. An `EplusJob` object will be returned which provides detailed
information of the simulation and methods to collect simulation output. Please
see `?job` for more detailed.

```{r run, eval = can_run}
# read the model again
model <- read_idf("5Zone_Transformer.idf", idd = NULL)

job <- model$run(epw_sf, dir = ".", wait = TRUE)
job
```

### Print simulation errors

You can get simulation errors using `$errors()`.

```{r errors, eval = can_run}
job$errors()
```

### Retrieve simulation output

eplusr uses the EnergyPlus SQL output for extracting simulation output. In
order to do so, an object in `Output:SQLite` class with `Option Type` value of
`SimpleAndTabular` will be automatically created if it does not exists.
`EplusJob` has provided some wrappers that do SQL queries to get report data
results, i.e. results from `Output:Variable` and `Output:Meter*`. But for
`Output:Table` results, you have to be familiar with the structure of the
EnergyPlus SQL output, especially for table *"TabularDataWithStrings"*. For
details, please see *"2.20 eplusout.sql"*, especially *"2.20.4.4 TabularData
Table"* in EnergyPlus *"Output Details and Examples"* documentation.

`$report_data_dict()` returns a data.table which contains all information about
report data. For details on the meaning of each columns, please see
*"2.20.2.1 ReportDataDictionary Table"* in EnergyPlus *"Output Details and
Examples"* documentation.

```{r dict, eval = can_run}
str(job$report_data_dict())
```

`$report_data()` extracts the report data using key values and variable names.
Basically, `key_value` equals `KeyValue` and `name` equals `Name` in the report
data dictionary you get from `$report_data_dict()`.

```{r output, eval = can_run}
str(job$report_data(name = "Site Outdoor Air Drybulb Temperature"))
```

`$tabular_data()` extracts all tabular data. For details on the meaning of each
columns, please see *"2.20.4.4 TabularData Table"* in EnergyPlus *"Output
Details and Examples"* documentation.

```{r tab, eval = can_run}
str(job$tabular_data())
```

```{r del_job, include = FALSE, eval = can_run}
clean_wd(model$path())
```

## Run Parametric Analysis

eplusr provides tools to do parametric simulations which take full advantages of
eplusr's model editing and result collecting functionalities.  You can create a
parametric job using `param_job()`, which takes an IDF file or an `Idf` object
as the *seed* and an EPW file or an `Epw` object as *weather*.

```{r param, eval = can_run}
param <- param_job(idf = model, epw = epw_sf)

param
```

`param_job()` returns a `ParametricJob` object which provides a prototype of
conducting parametric analysis of EnergyPlus simulations. For more details,
please see `?param`.

### Apply measure

`$apply_measure()` allows to apply a measure to an `Idf` and create parametric
models for simulations. Here, the concept of measure in eplusr is inspired by
"measures" in [OpenStudio](https://nrel.github.io/OpenStudio-user-documentation/getting_started/about_measures/).
Basically, a measure is just a function that takes an `Idf` object and other
arguments as input, and returns a modified `Idf` object as output. Use `...` to
supply different arguments to that measure.

Let's create a function that modifies infiltration rate:

```{r mea, eval = can_run}
set_infil_rate <- function (idf, infil_rate) {

    # validate input value
    # this is optional, as validations will be performed when setting values
    stopifnot(is.numeric(infil_rate), infil_rate >= 0)

    if (!idf$is_valid_class("ZoneInfiltration:DesignFlowRate"))
      stop("Input model does not have any object in class `ZoneInfiltration:DesignFlowRate`")

    ids <- idf$object_id("ZoneInfiltration:DesignFlowRate", simplify = TRUE)

    idf$set_object(ids,
        value = rep(list(list(
            design_flow_rate_calculation_method = "AirChanges/Hour",
            air_changes_per_hour = infil_rate)),
            times = length(ids))
        )

    idf
}
```

The measure `set_infil_rate()` is pretty simple. First, it gets all
objects in class `ZoneInfiltration:DesignFlowRate`. Then it sets ACH in all
zones to the input value.

Now, let's apply this measure to the seed model with different infiltration
rates from 0.0 to 4.0, respectively.

```{r apply, eval = can_run}
param$apply_measure(set_infil_rate, seq(0, 4, by = 1), .names = NULL)
```

As we can see, 5 models have been created. As we left `.names` as `NULL`, each
newly created models will be named as a combination of measure name and model
number.

### Run in parallel and collect results

Now let's run the parametric job. All simulations will be run in parallel. The
number of parallel EnergyPlus processes can be specified using option
`num_parallel`.

> Currently, unlike `EplusJob`, all simulations in `ParametricJob` will be run
> in waiting mode. This may be changed in the future.

```{r param_run, eval = can_run}
param$run()
```

After all simulations completed, let's see the variations of total energy.
