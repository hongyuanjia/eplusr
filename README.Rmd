> A Toolkit for Using EnergyPlus in R.

eplusr provides a rich toolkit of using whole building energy simulation program
[EnergyPlus](https://energyplus.net) directly in R, which enables programmatic
navigation, modification of EnergyPlus, conducts parametric simulations and
retrieves outputs. More information about EnergyPlus can be found at [its
website](https://energyplus.net).

A comprehensive introduction to eplusr can be found using
[`vignette("eplusr")`](https://hongyuanjia.github.io/eplusr/articles/eplusr.html).
There is also an online slides here ([Interfacing EnergyPlus Using
R](https://hongyuanjia.github.io/eplusrIntro/)).  You can learn more about eplusr
at https://hongyuanjia.github.io/eplusr/, along with full package documentation.

## How to cite

```{r}
citation("eplusr")
```

## Installation

You can install the latest stable release of eplusr from CRAN.

```{r cran-install, eval = FALSE}
install.packages("eplusr")
```

Alternatively, you can install the development version from GitHub.

```{r gh-installation, eval = FALSE}
# install.packages("remotes")
remotes::install_github("hongyuanjia/eplusr")
```

Since running the IDF files requires EnergyPlus (https://energyplus.net),
EnergyPlus has to be installed if you want to run EnergyPlus models in R.  There
are helper functions in eplusr to download and install it automatically on major
operating systems (Windows, macOS and Linux):

```{r eplus-install, eval = FALSE}
# install the latest version (currently v9.3.0)
eplusr::install_eplus("latest")

# OR download the latest version (currently v9.3.0) and run the installer
# manually by yourself
eplusr::download_eplus("latest", dir = tempdir())
```

Note that the installation process in `install_eplus()` requires
**administrative privileges**. You have to run R with administrator (or with
sudo if you are on macOS or Linux) to make it work if you are not in interactive
mode.

```{r install_eplus, include = FALSE}
if (!eplusr::is_avail_eplus(8.8)) eplusr::install_eplus(8.8)
```

## Features

* Download, install EnergyPlus in R
* Read, parse and modify EnergyPlus:
  - Input Data File (IDF)
  - Weather File (EPW)
  - Report Data Dictionary (RDD) & Meter Data Dictionary (MDD)
  - Error File (ERR)
* Modify multiple versions of IDFs and run corresponding EnergyPlus both in the
  background and in the front
* Rich-featured interfaces to query and modify IDFs
* Automatically handle referenced fields and validate input during modification
* Take fully advantage of most common used data structure for data science in
  R – data.frame
  - Extract model, weather data into data.frames
  - Modify multiple objects via data.frames input
  - Query output via SQL in Tidy format which is much better for data analysis
    and visualization
* Provide a simple yet extensible prototype of conducting parametric simulations
  and collect all results in one go
* A pure R-based version updater which is more than
  [20X](https://hongyuanjia.github.io/eplusr/articles/transition.html)
  faster than VersionUpdater distributed with EnergyPlus
* Fast 3D geometry visualization

**View IDF geometry in 3D**\
```{r, echo = FALSE, out.width = "60%"}
knitr::include_graphics("https://github.com/hongyuanjia/eplusr/blob/master/tools/figures/view_geometry.gif?raw=true")
```

**Turn RStudio into a model editor via autocompletion**\
```{r, echo = FALSE, out.width = "60%"}
knitr::include_graphics("https://github.com/hongyuanjia/eplusr/blob/master/tools/figures/autocomplete.gif?raw=true")
```

**Query and modify weather file**\
```{r, echo = FALSE, out.width = "60%"}
knitr::include_graphics("https://github.com/hongyuanjia/eplusr/blob/master/tools/figures/epw.gif?raw=true")
```

**Query output via SQL in Tidy format which is much better for data analysis**\
```{r, echo = FALSE, out.width = "60%"}
knitr::include_graphics("https://github.com/hongyuanjia/eplusr/blob/master/tools/figures/job.gif?raw=true")
```
