> A Toolkit for Using EnergyPlus in R.

eplusr provides a rich toolkit of using whole building energy simulation program
[EnergyPlus](https://energyplus.net) directly in R, which enables programmatic
navigation, modification of EnergyPlus, conducts parametric simulations and
retrieves outputs. More information about EnergyPlus can be found at [its
website](https://energyplus.net).

A comprehensive introduction to eplusr can be found using
[`vignette("eplusr")`](https://hongyuanjia.github.io/eplusr/articles/eplusr.html).
There is also an online slides here ([Interfacing EnergyPlus Using
R](https://hongyuanjia.github.io/eplusrIntro)).  You can learn more about eplusr
at https://hongyuanjia.github.io/eplusr, along with full package documentation.

## Installation

You can install the latest stable release of eplusr from CRAN.

```{r cran-install, eval = FALSE}
install.packages("eplusr")
```

Alternatively, you can install the development version from GitHub.

```{r gh-installation, eval = FALSE}
# install.packages("remotes")
remotes::install_github("hongyuanjia/eplusr")
```

Since running the IDF files requires EnergyPlus (https://energyplus.net),
EnergyPlus has to be installed if you want to run EnergyPlus models in R.  There
are helper functions in eplusr to download and install it automatically on major
operating systems (Windows, macOS and Linux):

```{r eplus-install, eval = FALSE}
# install the latest version (currently v9.1.0)
eplusr::install_eplus("latest")

# OR download the latest version (currently v9.1.0) and run the installer
# manually by yourself
eplusr::download_eplus("latest", dir = tempdir())
```

Note that the installation process in `install_eplus()` requires
**administrative privileges**. You have to run R with administrator (or with
sudo if you are on macOS or Linux) to make it work if you are not in interactive
mode.

```{r install_eplus, include = FALSE}
if (!eplusr::is_avail_eplus(8.8)) eplusr::install_eplus(8.8)
```

## Features

* Download, install EnergyPlus in R
* Read, parse and modify EnergyPlus:
  - Input Data File (IDF)
  - Weather File (EPW)
  - Report Data Dictionary (RDD) & Meter Data Dictionary (MDD)
  - Error File (ERR)
* Modify multiple versions of IDFs and run corresponding EnergyPlus both in the
  background and in the front
* Rich-featured interfaces to query and modify IDFs
* Automatically handle referenced fields and validate input during modification
* Take fully advantage of most common used data structure for data science in
  R – data.frame
  - Extract model, weather data into data.frames
  - Modify multiple objects via data.frames input
  - Query output via SQL in Tidy format which is much better for data analysis
    and visualization
* Provide a simple yet extensible prototype of conducting parametric simulations
  and collect all results in one go
* A pure R-based version updater which is more than
  [20X](https://hongyuanjia.me/en/2019/08/update-energyplus-using-eplusr-transition)
  faster than VersionUpdater distributed with EnergyPlus

**Turn RStudio into a model editor via autocompletion**\
```{r, echo = FALSE, out.width = "60%"}
knitr::include_graphics("https://github.com/hongyuanjia/eplusr/blob/master/tools/figures/autocomplete.gif?raw=true")
```

**Query and modify weather file**\
```{r, echo = FALSE, out.width = "60%"}
knitr::include_graphics("https://github.com/hongyuanjia/eplusr/blob/master/tools/figures/epw.gif?raw=true")
```

**Query output via SQL in Tidy format which is much better for data analysis**\
```{r, echo = FALSE, out.width = "60%"}
knitr::include_graphics("https://github.com/hongyuanjia/eplusr/blob/master/tools/figures/job.gif?raw=true")
```

## Usage overview

### Class structure

Below shows the class structure in eplusr.

```{r, echo = FALSE, fig.align = "center"}
knitr::include_graphics("man/figures/class_structure.png")
```

Basically, eplusr uses `Idf` class to present the whole IDF file and `IdfObject`
class to present a single object in an IDF. Both `Idf` and `IdfObject` class
contain member functions for helping modify the data in IDF so it complies with
the underlying EnergyPlus IDD (Input Data Dictionary). Similarly, IDD file is
wrapped into two classes, i.e. `Idd` and `IddObject`.

Besides, `Epw` class is used to present EnergyPlus Weather files; `EplusJob` to
run single EnergyPlus simulation and collect outputs, `ParametricJob` to run
parametric EnergyPlus simulations and collect all outputs.

It is highly recommended to read the documentation to get a thorough
understanding on each class.

### Getting started

```{r load, out.lines = 30}
library(eplusr)

# parse IDD
idd <- use_idd(8.8, download = "auto")

# read IDF
idf <- read_idf(system.file("extdata/1ZoneUncontrolled.idf", package = "eplusr"))

# print idf
idf

# extract object
idf$Material_NoMass$R13LAYER

# get object relation
idf$object_relation("R13LAYER", "all")

# extract field value
idf$RunPeriod[[1]][c("Begin Month", "End Month")]

# add new object
idf$add(RunPeriod = list("run_period", 3, 1, 4, 1))

# get possible values for fields
idf$Construction$FLOOR$value_possible("Outside Layer")

# extract object data
idf$to_table(class = "BuildingSurface:Detailed", string_value = FALSE, unit = TRUE)

# read EPW
path_epw <- file.path(eplus_config(8.8)$dir, "WeatherData/USA_CA_San.Francisco.Intl.AP.724940_TMY3.epw")
epw <- read_epw(path_epw)

# print weather
epw

# get location
(loc <- epw$location())

# update Site:Location according to EPW LOCATION header
idf$Site_Location$set(
  name = paste(loc$city, loc$state_province, loc$country),
  loc$latitude, loc$longitude, loc$time_zone, loc$elevation
)

# save the IDF
idf$save(file.path(tempdir(), "model.idf"), overwrite = TRUE)

# extract weather data
(weather <- head(epw$data()))

# a date time column added with correct start day of week type
epw$period()$start_day_of_week
weekdays(weather$datetime)

# run simulation
job <- idf$run(epw)

# print simulation error
job$errors()

# get report data
results <- job$report_data("zone one", "zone mean air temperature",
  case = "example", month = 1:6, hour = 1, day_type = "Monday",
  all = TRUE
)
str(results)

# a date time column added with correct day of week type
all(weekdays(results$datetime) == results$day_type)

# get tabular data
job$tabular_data(table_name = "site and source energy", row_name = "total site energy", wide = TRUE)
```

```{r del_job, include = FALSE}
clean_wd(idf$path())
unlink(idf$path())
```
