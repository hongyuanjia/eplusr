download_weather(
  pattern,

\code{"ddy"}. If \code{"all"}, both weather files and design day files will be
downloaded.}

\item{ask}{If \code{TRUE}, a command line menu will be shown to let you select
which one to download. If \code{FALSE} and the number of returned results is
less than \code{max_match}, files are downloaded automatically without asking.}

\item{max_match}{The max results allowed to download when \code{ask} is \code{FALSE}.}
