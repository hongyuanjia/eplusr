\usage{
download_weather(
  pattern,
  filename = NULL,
  dir = ".",
  type = c("all", "epw", "ddy", "stat"),
  ask = TRUE,
  max_match = 3
)
}
\arguments{
\item{pattern}{A regular expression used to search locations, e.g. \code{"los angeles.*tmy3"}. The search is case-insensitive.}

\item{filename}{File names (without extension) used to save downloaded files.
Internally, \code{\link[=make.unique]{make.unique()}} is called to ensure unique names.}

\item{dir}{Directory to save downloaded files. Will create if not exist.}

\item{type}{File type to download. Only applicable to data provided by
EnergyPlus website. For OneBuilding.org, \code{"all"} will always be used.
Should be one of \code{"all"}, \code{"epw"}, \code{"ddy"} and \code{"stat"}. If \code{"all"}, all
weather data will be downloaded in a ZIP file. Default: \code{"all"}.}

\item{ask}{If \code{TRUE}, a command line menu will be shown to let you select
which one to download. If \code{FALSE} and the number of returned results is
less than \code{max_match}, files are downloaded automatically without asking.}

\item{max_match}{The max results allowed to download when \code{ask} is \code{FALSE}.}
}
\value{
A character vector containing paths of downloaded files.
}

There are 2 data sources:
\itemize{
\item \href{https://energyplus.net/weather}{EnergyPlus.net}
\item \href{http://climate.onebuilding.org/}{OneBuilding.org}
}

EnergyPlus sources allow downloading EPW, STAT, and DDY files separately
while OneBuilding sources can only download them all through a ZIP file.
