\title{Add a padding time column for further aggregation.}
\usage{
time_col_add(data, based_col = NULL, interval = "level_up",
  new_name = NULL, one_year = FALSE)
}
\arguments{
\item{data}{A data frame containing at least one datetime variable of class
'Date', class 'POSIXct' or class 'POSIXlt'.}

"month", "week", "day", "hour", "min").}

\item{new_name}{The column name of the added variable. If 'NULL' it will be
the name of the original datetime variable with the interval name added to
it, separeted by an underscore.}

\item{one_year}{If TRUE, the (year+1)-01-01 will be replaced with

\description{
\code{time_col_add} adds a padding time column in a data.table for further
easy data aggregation. Basically, this is a wrapper function of
\code{\link[padr]{thicken}} but with an extra feature to give an exact number
of minutes of interval. It can also replace the datetime that is
(year+1)-01-01 with (year)-12-31.
