\description{
\code{clean_wd} is a function to clean the working directory of EnergyPlus
after backing up specifed files. All other files that are not parts of
EnergyPlus input or output files will be left as it is.  This is also true if
you rename those files of EnergyPlus before you run this function. Currently,
files work as input schedule files are not supported, and will be left
untouched.
