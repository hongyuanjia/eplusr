Parse Energy+.idd file
}
\details{
The IDD files for EnergyPlus 8.1 to 8.8 have been pre-parsed and
stored internally and will automatically be used when parsing \code{IDF} and
\code{IMF} files. The parsing process was basically the same as that was
implemented in IDFEditor distributed with EnergyPlus, but using the powerful
\code{data.table} package to speed up the whole process and store the
results. The souce codes of IDFEditor can be found on
\href{GitHub}{https://github.com/NREL/EnergyPlus/tree/develop/src/IDF_Editor}:
. However, it will still take about 3-4 sec to parse an IDD file which is
much slower than IDFEditor written in Visual Basic.
